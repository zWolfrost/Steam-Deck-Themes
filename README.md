# Steam Deck Themes by zWolfrost
This repository will contain css themes developed by me for CSSLoader.

## Edit Featured Banner (formerly known as Remove Wide Banner)
This theme will let you edit the banner of the last played game aka featured game to be a capsule or a square (depending on your preference).
Unfortunately, this will require the banner image to become either cut, stretched or contained (depending on your preference).
In order to ease this issue, i recommend setting the wide capsule images to square ones using SteamGridDB.
