# Remove Wide Banner
 This theme will replace the wide capsule banner of the last played game aka featured game with a capsule.
 Unfortunately, this will require the image to become either cut, stretched or smaller, depending on your preference.
 In order to ease this issue, i recommend to set the wide capsule banners to square ones using steamgridb.
 Big thanks to Matthias#8282/MSeys, whose themes' css helped me a lot to create this.
